### Local

To make this work locally, we recommend using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a globally available URL for fast testing.

`npm install`  
`npm run build`  
`npm start`  
`ngrok http 3001`

## Register

Follow the instructions for [registering a SmartApp](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/docs/smartapps/app-registration.html) with the SmartThings platform.

- The following OAuth2 scopes are required.
    - `r:devices:*` 
    - `x:devices:*` 

A `CONFIRMATION request` log should show in the log output of the server once registered. Navigate to this link to [verify your domain ownership](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/docs/smartapps/webhook-apps.html#Verify-your-domain-ownership) and enable the app to receive events. **This is required for successful installation.**

## Test

Follow the instructions for [testing a SmartApp](https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/docs/testing/how-to-test.html).
